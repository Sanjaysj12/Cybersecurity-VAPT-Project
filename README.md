🛡️ Cybersecurity VAPT Project

🔍 Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (Oct 2024)

This academic project involved performing a full-scale VAPT on simulated banking and web applications. The goal was to identify critical security flaws and recommend remediation strategies aligned with industry standards.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Reconnaissance & Scanning:** Nmap, Nessus
- **Exploitation:** Metasploit, Burp Suite, SQLMap
- **Operating Systems:** Kali Linux, Windows 10
- **Frameworks & Standards:** OWASP Top 10, NIST CSF


⚠️ Key Vulnerabilities Discovered
| Vulnerability Type | Severity (CVSS) | Description |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------|
| SQL Injection      | 9.8              | Unauthorized data access via login bypass |
| Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | 8.2 | Client-side script injection |
| SMB Exploits       | 8.5              | Lateral movement via insecure file sharing |
| Active Directory Misconfig | 7.9 | Privilege escalation and credential harvesting |


✅ Remediation Highlights
- Implemented input validation and parameterized queries to mitigate SQLi.
- Enforced Content Security Policy (CSP) and output encoding to prevent XSS.
- Disabled SMBv1 and enforced strong access controls.
- Hardened AD policies and enabled auditing for suspicious activity.

📄 Deliverables
- **15-page VAPT Report** with detailed findings, screenshots, CVSS scores, and mitigation steps.
- **Remediation Plan** aligned with OWASP and NIST guidelines.
- **Presentation Slides** summarizing the attack vectors and security recommendations.
